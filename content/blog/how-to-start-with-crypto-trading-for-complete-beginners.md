## Why Choosing the Right Exchange Matters

A crypto exchange is where you buy and sell coins.  
Unlike banks, not all exchanges are safe.  

- Some were **hacked** and lost customer money.  
- Others collapsed; users suffered losses (e.g., Mt. Gox and FTX).

That’s why the first choice is crucial: pick an exchange that’s been around for years, survived problems, and proven trustworthy.  

**Examples of large, well-known exchanges (not endorsements). Do your own due diligence:**

- [Binance.com](https://accounts.binance.com/register?ref=16728099) – biggest by trading volume, huge selection.  
- [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/exch/nz9zydgyex) – regulated in many countries, solid reputation.  
- [Bitfinex.com](https://www.bitfinex.com/sign-up?refcode=HDt9azeLD) – one of the oldest; even after a hack, they repaid users fully.  

⚠️ Rule: Avoid new or unknown exchanges. If they disappear, your money does too.

## First Baby Steps

Think of your **first year** like learning to ride a bike with training wheels. The goal is **not making money fast**, but practicing safely.  

1. **Sign up** at one trusted exchange.  
2. **Enable 2FA** – like adding a deadbolt lock to your house.  
3. **Deposit a small test amount** – your “school tuition.” Never risk what you can’t afford to lose.  
4. **Trade only in the spot market.** This is simple buying and selling. Avoid margin/leverage (borrowing money), it’s like gambling with debt.

## Core Trading Principles

### 1. Diversification (Don’t Put All Eggs in One Basket)

In crypto, you want exposure to different **sectors/narratives**. That way, if one area crashes, others may still do fine.  

**Examples of crypto sectors:**  

- **Store of Value (digital gold)** → Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC)  
- **Smart Contract Platforms (like operating systems)** → Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX)  
- **DeFi (Decentralized Finance)** → Uniswap (UNI), Aave (AAVE), Curve (CRV)  
- **Gaming & Metaverse** → Axie Infinity (AXS), Sandbox (SAND), Illuvium (ILV)  
- **AI & Data** → Fetch.ai (FET), Render (RNDR), Ocean Protocol (OCEAN)  
- **Stablecoins & Payments** → USDT, USDC, XRP, Stellar (XLM)  

**Example portfolio ($1,000):**  

- $400 → BTC (digital gold)  
- $300 → ETH (smart contracts)  
- $200 → AAVE (DeFi)  
- $100 → FET (AI)  

This way, if DeFi or AI coins crash, BTC and ETH might still keep value.

### 2. Risk Management (Small Bites, Not Big Jumps)

Risk management is what keeps you alive long enough to learn and profit.  

#### 2.1 Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)

Never “go all in” at once. Spread across coins **and** spread over time.  

**Example:** You have $1,000 → want 3 coins.  

- Split into 3 parts: $333 each.  
- Don’t buy $333 in one go. Split further into 3 smaller buys (like $100 each).  

This reduces the risk of buying at the wrong time.  

---

#### 2.2 Risk-to-Reward Ratio (R:R)

This tells you:  

- **How much you risk losing** vs. **how much you plan to gain** on a trade.  
- Smart traders only take setups where reward is at least **2× the risk**.  

**How to calculate R:R (step by step):**  

1. **Entry:** Buy ETH at $2,000  
2. **Stop-loss:** If ETH falls to $1,900 → Risk = $100  
3. **Target:** Sell at $2,300 → Reward = $300  
4. **Ratio:** Risk $100 : Reward $300 = **1:3**  

This is a favorable example setup for many traders.

---

**Why it matters:**  

- If you only take trades with 1:2 or better, you don’t need to win every time.  
- Example (10 trades risking $100 each):  
  - 4 wins at 1:3 = +$1,200  
  - 6 losses = -$600  
  - Net = +$600 profit (even with more losses than wins!).  

---

**Common beginner mistakes:**  

- Risking more than the potential reward (e.g., risking $300 to make $100).  
- Moving stop-loss lower (“just in case it bounces”).  
- Not setting a stop/target at all → emotional chaos.  

---

### 3. Your Mental State (Don’t Let Emotions Drive You)

Crypto feels like a rollercoaster.  

- Prices up → greed → “I must buy now!”  
- Prices down → fear → “I must sell before I lose more!”  

But usually, the **best choices are the opposite**:  

- Don’t chase green candles (buying too late).  
- Don’t panic-sell at the bottom.  

Instead:  

- **Buy when it feels scary** (if the project is solid).  
- **Sell when you already have profit.** Even if it goes higher, profit in hand is better than regret.

### 4. Fundamental Analysis (FA) – The Project Behind the Coin

Before buying, check the **foundation**:  

- **Team:** Are they experienced and transparent?  
- **Community:** Is the Discord lively, or dead?  
- **Roadmap:** Are promises delivered?  
- **Adoption:** Are real companies using it?  
- **Tokenomics:** Who controls supply?  
- **Regulation:** Any legal risks?  

**Example:**  

- Project “SafeCoin” → strong team, updates, adoption = safer.  
- Project “MoonScam” → anonymous founders, no updates = avoid.

### 5. Technical Analysis (TA) – Reading the Charts

Charts reflect crowd psychology.  
You can’t predict exactly, but you can anticipate likely turning points.  

We’ll cover 5 simple tools:  

1. **Support & Resistance**  
2. **Trend**  
3. **Moving Averages (MAs)**  
4. **Volume**  
5. **Fibonacci Retracements**

#### 5.1 Support & Resistance

- Support = price floor where drops bounce.  
- Resistance = price ceiling where rallies stall.  

Buy near support, sell near resistance.  

![Example: price hit support at $0.09 → buy, price hit resistance at 0.09 → sell (if you didnt sell earlier, then now you were able to cut your position at breakeven when the trend changed into down side)](support-and-resistance.png)

---

#### 5.2 Trend

- Uptrend = higher highs & higher lows.  
- Downtrend = lower highs & lower lows.  

Rule: **Don’t fight the trend.** If you are in a down trend, then you should be selling. If you are in an up trend, then you should be buying.

![Down trend example](down-trend.png)
![Up trend example](up-trend.png)

---

#### 5.3 Moving Averages

- 50-day MA = short-term trend.  
- 200-day MA = long-term health.  
- Golden Cross = bullish. Death Cross = bearish.  

**Hint:** Some traders only buy when price is above the 200‑day MA..  

![Only buy when price is above 200-day MA.](sma-cross-over.png)

---

#### 5.4 Volume

- High volume = strong move.  
- Low volume = weak/fake move.  

**Example:** Breakout at $2,400 with high volume → more reliable.  

![Volume indicators bars signal strength of price movement](volume-indicator.png)

---

#### 5.5 Fibonacci

- Helps spot where pullbacks may bounce (38%, 50%, 62%).  

Fibonacci levels are a tool to help you spot where pullbacks may bounce.

### 6. Beginner-Friendly Strategies

1. **DCA (Core)** → Buy small amounts weekly.  
2. **Trend Following** → Buy dips in uptrend, avoid downtrends.  
3. **Swing Trading** → Buy support, sell resistance.  
4. **Profit Ladder** → Sell in 3 steps (+10%, +20%, +35%).
