# How to Use AI to Build Apps at 10× Speed

Building apps today isn’t what it used to be.  
I remember when a “prototype in a week” felt fast. Now, with the right AI setup, I can get there in a day — **if I use the tools together in the right way**.

This isn’t a hype piece. It’s my own workflow, including the good, the bad, and the “why is this AI making things *worse*” moments.

## 1. The AI Stack I Use

I’ve tried a lot of AI tools. Most of them either shine at one thing or try to do everything and stumble.  
Here’s the setup that works for me.

### ChatGPT – Quick answers & brainstorming  

I treat ChatGPT like that developer friend I can text at 1 AM with a “how does this library work again?” question.  

- I use it for writing text content, explaining code, or giving quick solutions for small problems.
- It’s not my main coding buddy, but great for unblocking small stuff.

**Example prompt:**  

```bash
Help me define the brand persona and archetype and create a BRAND.md
```

> *I’ve used this to get a clear brand voice early in a project so everything — from copy to UI tone — feels consistent.*

### v0 – Lightning-fast UI bootstrapping  

v0 is perfect for *day one*. I describe my app, it gives me a functioning UI skeleton.  
But here’s the thing:  

- Beyond that first day, v0 starts to struggle with complexity. It can’t handle custom libraries well, or future-proof code structures.
- I’ve ended up in “fixing circles” with it, where the AI keeps trying to solve its own mess… and fails.  

So now I just take the initial layout for free, commit it, and move on.

> *Once, I spent an hour trying to convince v0 to use a certain library. It refused. I gave up, exported the layout, and finished the rest in Cursor in 20 minutes.*

### Claude Code – Architecture & co-programmer  

I treat Claude like a senior engineer:  

- It helps me plan architectures, write technical docs, and create coding guidelines.  
- Instead of saying “build this feature now,” I ask it to **suggest multiple approaches first**, then pick one.  
- If I don’t have coding guidelines yet, Claude will happily create them for me (and even ask about my preferences).  

**Example prompt:**  

```bash
Help me plan the architecture and folder structure, ask me questions and propose solutions
```

> *This works well because Claude starts by gathering context, then offers several approaches — which I can choose from before coding starts.*

---

### Cursor IDE – Where it all comes together  

Cursor is where I actually write code — with AI chat integrated right into the editor.  

- I can save style rules, coding preferences, or even “never do this again” notes directly into Cursor’s memory.  
- It’s also the one paid tool I recommend if your budget is tight — you can access ChatGPT from inside Cursor without a separate subscription.  

> *The “never do this again” rule in Cursor saved me from a React component naming disaster once. Worth every cent.*

## 2. The Workflow That Makes It Work

Using AI without a process is like driving a sports car in first gear — still faster than walking, but nowhere near what it could be.

Here’s the loop I follow for every feature:

1. **Plan** – Ask Claude to suggest approaches. Decide which one to use.  
2. **Implement** – Use Cursor + Claude Code to code it.  
3. **Test & Fix** – Let Claude Code run the tests and fix the bugs.

I repeat this for *every* feature or change request.  
Skipping the planning phase is the #1 cause of wasted time for me.

> *I used to skip planning and go straight into “AI, build it” mode. 3 hours later I’d have something that looked right but was completely wrong under the hood.*

## 3. Bug Fixing: Lower Your Expectations

AI bug fixing is a mixed bag:  

- Sometimes it’s magic and solves it instantly.  
- Sometimes it makes random changes that do nothing.  
- Sometimes I have to ask *again* in slightly different words.  

When that happens, I just Google the solution like in the old days, then paste it into AI to integrate.  
That way I still save time, but avoid going in circles.

> *I once spent 40 minutes trying to get AI to fix a bug… then found the answer in a 7-year-old Stack Overflow post. The fix took 30 seconds.*

## 4. Keeping AI on Track

One of the best things I’ve done is keep a **project memory file**:

- In Cursor: add rules/memory so the AI remembers my style.  
- In Claude: keep a `CLAUDE.md` file with coding guidelines and decisions.  
- In Git: commit my guidelines so the whole team can use them.

This avoids the “why did you suddenly decide to use snake_case in a React project?” moments.

> *The first time I saw AI suddenly switch coding styles mid-project, I realized I needed to start writing things down for it. Treat AI like a forgetful intern.*

## 5. Mini Case Study – A Feature in a Day

I recently built a dashboard widget for a client in under 24 hours:  

1. **UI Foundation** – Generated with v0 in 10 minutes.  
2. **Architecture Plan** – Claude suggested 3 approaches, I picked one.  
3. **Implementation** – Cursor wrote 80% of the code, I handled edge cases manually.  
4. **Bug Fixes** – One bug was solved by AI, another I found on Stack Overflow.  
Total time: ~7 hours. Traditionally, this would have been 2–3 days.

> *The best part? The client thought I’d been working on it for a week.*

## 6. Final Thoughts

AI won’t replace good developers anytime soon, but it *will* turn a good developer into a hyper-productive one.  
The key is:

- Use each tool for what it’s best at.
- Work in short, planned iterations.
- Document your preferences so AI doesn’t forget.

That’s how I get to **10× speed** without burning out or drowning in AI mistakes.

*If you try this workflow, let me know how it goes. I’m still refining mine, and the more battle stories, the better.*
