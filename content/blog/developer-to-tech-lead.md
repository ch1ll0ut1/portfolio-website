# From Developer to Tech Lead: The Skills They Don't Teach You

Technical expertise got you promoted, but leadership requires a completely different skill set. Here's what I wish I knew when I made the transition.

## The Harsh Reality

Your first few months as a tech lead will be uncomfortable. You'll feel like you're not contributing "real work" anymore. Code reviews, meetings, and planning sessions will replace the satisfaction of shipping features.

This is normal. You're learning a new job.

## The Essential Skills

### 1. Communication Over Code

Your primary tool is no longer your IDE—it's communication.

**Before (as a developer):**
- Focus on perfect implementations
- Optimize for individual productivity
- Communicate primarily through code

**After (as a tech lead):**
- Focus on team understanding
- Optimize for team productivity
- Communicate constantly and clearly

### 2. Decision-Making Framework

As a tech lead, you make dozens of technical decisions daily. Develop a framework:

```typescript
interface TechnicalDecision {
    context: string;
    options: TechnicalOption[];
    criteria: DecisionCriteria;
    stakeholders: string[];
    timeline: Date;
}

interface DecisionCriteria {
    performance: number;      // 1-10 importance
    maintainability: number;  // 1-10 importance
    timeline: number;         // 1-10 importance
    team_expertise: number;   // 1-10 importance
    cost: number;            // 1-10 importance
}
```

### 3. The Art of Delegation

**Don't delegate tasks you don't understand.** Before giving someone work:
- Understand the requirements yourself
- Know what success looks like
- Identify potential blockers
- Set clear check-in points

### 4. Managing Technical Debt

You're now responsible for the long-term health of the codebase:

```javascript
// Create a technical debt register
const technicalDebtItems = [
    {
        area: "Authentication system",
        impact: "High",           // High/Medium/Low
        effort: "Medium",         // High/Medium/Low  
        risk: "Security vulnerability if not addressed",
        timeline: "Next quarter"
    }
];
```

## Common Mistakes I Made

### 1. Trying to Code Everything
**Mistake**: Jumping into every coding task
**Better**: Review, guide, and unblock others

### 2. Making All Decisions Alone
**Mistake**: Deciding architecture without team input
**Better**: Facilitate decisions with the team

### 3. Avoiding Difficult Conversations
**Mistake**: Hoping performance issues resolve themselves
**Better**: Address issues early and directly

### 4. Not Investing in Team Growth
**Mistake**: Focusing only on project delivery
**Better**: Balance delivery with team development

## Your New Daily Routine

**Morning (9-11 AM):**
- Review overnight issues/deployments
- Check team progress and blockers
- Respond to urgent technical questions

**Mid-day (11 AM-2 PM):**
- Deep work: architecture, planning, reviews
- One-on-ones with team members
- Stakeholder communication

**Afternoon (2-5 PM):**
- Code reviews and technical guidance
- Cross-team collaboration
- Documentation and knowledge sharing

## The Mindset Shift

**From:** "How can I write the best code?"
**To:** "How can I help my team write the best code?"

**From:** "I need to understand every detail"
**To:** "I need to understand the critical path and trust my team with details"

**From:** "My value is in my output"
**To:** "My value is in enabling others' output"

## Measuring Success

Your success metrics change:

**Individual Contributor Metrics:**
- Lines of code
- Features shipped
- Bugs fixed

**Tech Lead Metrics:**
- Team velocity
- Code quality improvements
- Team member growth
- Project delivery consistency

## Conclusion

The transition from developer to tech lead is one of the most challenging career moves in technology. You're not just learning new skills—you're rewiring how you think about work and value.

Be patient with yourself. The discomfort you feel is growth happening. Focus on serving your team, and the technical leadership will follow naturally.

Remember: Great tech leads are made, not born. Every senior engineering leader has struggled with this transition. You're not alone.
